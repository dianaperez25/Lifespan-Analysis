For infomap processing
1. neet to make distance matrix that is subjects specific using the make_geo_sit_matrix script
2. then use that distance matrix to run the infomap script using the infomap_wrapper script
3. then run the post_infomap_proc script to make the actual network maps, though this script is not currently working too well :(
